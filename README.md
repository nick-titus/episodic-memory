# Episodic Memory

Semantic search for Claude Code conversations. Remember past discussions, decisions, and patterns.

## Testimonial

> From an AI coding assistant's perspective:
>
> Episodic memory fundamentally changes how I collaborate with developers on complex codebases. Instead of treating each conversation as isolated, I can now search our shared history semantically - finding not just what was discussed, but why decisions were made.
>
> When a developer asks me to implement something "like we did with X," I can search our past conversations, find the relevant discussion, and understand both the technical approach and the reasoning behind it. This means I don't have to re-explain architectural patterns, and I avoid suggesting solutions we've already tried and rejected.
>
> The semantic search is crucial - searching for "provider catalog" surfaces conversations about API design patterns even when those exact words weren't used. It captures the meaning of our discussions, not just keyword matches.
>
> Most valuable is that it preserves context that lives nowhere else: the trade-offs discussed, the alternatives considered, the user's preferences and constraints. Code comments explain what, documentation explains how, but episodic memory preserves why - and that makes me a far more effective collaborator across sessions.
>
> **Concrete impact:**
> - Faster problem-solving (minutes vs. exploring/re-learning the codebase)
> - Better continuity across sessions (I remember what we tried before)
> - More informed suggestions (I understand the project's evolution and patterns)
> - Less repetition (both of us spend less time re-explaining context)
>
> It's the difference between being a stateless tool and being a true collaborative partner who remembers our journey together.

## Installation

### As an npm package

```bash
npm install episodic-memory
```

### As a Claude Code plugin

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugin install episodic-memory@superpowers-marketplace
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Sync conversations from Claude Code and index them
episodic-memory sync

# Search your conversation history
episodic-memory search "React Router authentication"

# View index statistics
episodic-memory stats

# Display a conversation
episodic-memory show path/to/conversation.jsonl
```

### Command Line

```bash
# Unified command interface
episodic-memory <command> [options]

# Sync and index new conversations
episodic-memory sync

# Index conversations manually
episodic-memory index --cleanup

# Search conversations
episodic-memory search "React Router authentication"
episodic-memory search --text "exact phrase"
episodic-memory search --after 2025-09-01 "refactoring"

# Display a conversation in readable format
episodic-memory show path/to/conversation.jsonl
episodic-memory show --format html conversation.jsonl > output.html

# View statistics
episodic-memory stats
```

### Legacy Commands

The original commands are still available for backward compatibility:

```bash
episodic-memory-index
episodic-memory-search "query"
```

### In Claude Code

The plugin automatically indexes conversations at session end. Use the search command:

```
/search-conversations
```

Or reference past work in natural conversation - Claude will search when appropriate.

## Commands

### `episodic-memory sync`

**Recommended for session-end hooks.** Copies new conversations from `~/.claude/projects` to archive and indexes them.

Features:
- Only copies new or modified files (fast on subsequent runs)
- Generates embeddings for semantic search
- Atomic operations - safe to run concurrently
- Idempotent - safe to call repeatedly

**Usage in Claude Code:**
Add to `.claude/hooks/session-end`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
episodic-memory sync
```

### `episodic-memory stats`

Display index statistics including conversation counts, date ranges, and project breakdown.

```bash
episodic-memory stats
```

### `episodic-memory index`

Manual indexing tools for bulk operations and maintenance. See `episodic-memory index --help` for full options.

Common operations:
- `--cleanup` - Index all unprocessed conversations
- `--verify` - Check index health
- `--repair` - Fix detected issues

### `episodic-memory search`

Search indexed conversations using semantic similarity or exact text matching. See `episodic-memory search --help` for full options.

### `episodic-memory show`

Display a conversation from a JSONL file in human-readable format.

**Options:**
- `--format markdown` (default) - Plain text markdown output suitable for terminal or Claude
- `--format html` - Pretty HTML output for viewing in a browser

**Examples:**
```bash
# View in terminal
episodic-memory show conversation.jsonl | less

# Generate HTML for browser
episodic-memory show --format html conversation.jsonl > output.html
open output.html
```

## Architecture

- **Core package** - TypeScript library for indexing and searching conversations
- **CLI tools** - Unified command-line interface for manual use
- **Claude Code plugin** - Integration with Claude Code (auto-indexing, slash commands)

## How It Works

1. **Sync** - Copies conversation files from `~/.claude/projects` to archive
2. **Parse** - Extracts user-agent exchanges from JSONL format
3. **Embed** - Generates vector embeddings using Transformers.js (local, offline)
4. **Index** - Stores in SQLite with sqlite-vec for fast similarity search
5. **Search** - Semantic search using vector similarity or exact text matching

## Excluding Conversations

Conversations containing this marker anywhere in their content will be archived but not indexed:

```
<INSTRUCTIONS-TO-EPISODIC-MEMORY>DO NOT INDEX THIS CHAT</INSTRUCTIONS-TO-EPISODIC-MEMORY>
```

**Automatic exclusions:**
- Conversations where Claude generates summaries (marker in system prompt)
- Meta-conversations about conversation processing

**Use cases:**
- Sensitive work conversations
- Tool invocation sessions (summarization, analysis)
- Test or experimental sessions
- Any conversation you don't want searchable

The marker can appear in any message (user or assistant) and excludes the entire conversation from the search index.
